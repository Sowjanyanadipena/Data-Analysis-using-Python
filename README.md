# Titanic Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project performs data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python. It covers data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The dataset is loaded from Seaborn, so no external download is required.
## Features
- Load Titanic dataset directly from Seaborn
- Handle missing values and clean the data
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Visualize survival rates by gender, class, and age
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features
- Key insights from the data
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
## How to Run
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy and paste the full code block into the notebook
4. Run all cells
## Outputs
- Survival rate summary
- Bar plots for gender and class
- Age distribution histogram
- Correlation heatmap
## Insights
1. Women had higher survival rates than men
2. 1st Class passengers had better survival chances than 2nd and 3rd Class
3. Age shows a weak negative correlation with survival
